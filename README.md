# Digital_Nurture-4.0_Exercise

This repository contains my self-paced learning exercises for Cognizant's DN4.0 upskilling program.

Due to university final exams, I have completed essential basics and plan to revisit advanced modules after exams are over.

### Modules Included:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Basic layout and form example
- **SQL**: Sample table and query
- **Java**: Basic Hello World class

> I am committed to learning and completing any follow-up tasks once my academic exams are done.
